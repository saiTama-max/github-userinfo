# Prerequisites
- Font should be a [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for the icons to render, else they would look like blank boxes
# 
# 


## Running through the python file
To run from the python file, you must have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, then after cloning the repo, (git clone https://github.com/saiTama-max/github-userinfo.git),
you can cd to the folder `cd github-userinfo`, and run through `python ghinfo.py username` or `python3 ghinfo.py username`
# 

## Running through the executable (linux only)
To run from the executable, clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/saiTama-max/github-userinfo.git) and cd to the folder, `cd github-userinfo`,
and use the command `sudo chmod +x ./ghinfo` to make the exe executable by the user, and run through `./ghinfo username`

You can also move the exe (after making it executable through the above command) in the directory `/usr/bin` to make it a command, hence you can run it like `ghinfo username`
